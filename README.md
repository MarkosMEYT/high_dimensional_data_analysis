In this project we will be using vector quantization along with a dataset of cat images to show how image compression works. We will define all the required functions, including transfering a matrix into blocks and clustering them using k-means clustering, converting the compressed image into right format, and then try to analyze optimal parameter for compression using distance from original image.
